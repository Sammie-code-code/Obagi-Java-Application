//e) The class loader takes the .class files containing the program’s bytecodes and transfers them to primary memory. f) The examines bytecodes to ensure that they’re valid.
//f) The bytecode examines bytecodes to ensure that they’re valid.

//1.7 Explain the two compilation phases of Java programs. 
//a. Compilation Phase: The javac (Java compiler) translates the .java source code file into a .class file containing Java bytecode.
//b. Execution Phase: The java command runs the compiled .class file by passing it to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets the bytecode and executes it on the hardware.

//1.8 One of the world’s most common objects is a wrist watch. Discuss how each of the following terms and concepts applies to the notion of a watch: object, attributes, behaviors, class, inheritance (consider, for example, an alarm clock), modeling, messages, encapsulation, interface and information hiding.
//Object: A wristwatch is an object that has attributes and behaviors.
//Attributes: Color, brand, material, size, and type (analog/digital).
//Behaviors: Displaying time, setting alarms, showing date, stopwatch functionality.
//Class: A general blueprint for wristwatches defining common attributes and behaviors.
//Inheritance: An alarm clock is a subclass of a wristwatch, inheriting basic features and adding new ones like alarm functionality.
//Modeling: Representing wristwatch features using object-oriented programming.
//Messages: The watch reacts to user inputs (e.g., button presses to adjust time).
//Encapsulation: Internal mechanisms (like time-keeping circuits) are hidden from users.
//Interface: Buttons and dials provide a way to interact with the watch.
//Information Hiding: Users cannot directly modify the internal clock mechanism, only through controlled inputs.

//Making a Difference
//1.9 (Test-Drive: Carbon Footprint Calculator) 
//Some scientists believe that carbon emissions, especially from the burning of fossil fuels, contribute significantly to global warming and that this can be combatted if individuals take steps to limit their use of carbon-based fuels. Organizations and individuals are increasingly concerned about their “carbon footprints.” Websites such as TerraPass http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/ and Carbon Footprint http://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx provide carbon-footprint calculators. Test-drive these calculators to determine your carbon footprint. Exercises in later chapters will ask you to program your own carbon-footprint calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating carbon footprints. 

//1.10 (Test-Drive: Body Mass Index Calculator) 
//Obesity causes significant increases in illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. To determine whether a person is overweight or obese, you can use a measure called the body mass index (BMI). The United States Department of Health and Human Services provides a BMI calculator at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/ bmicalc.htm. Use it to calculate your own BMI. A forthcoming exercise will ask you to program your own BMI calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating BMI. 

//1.11 (Attributes of Hybrid Vehicles) 
//Hybrid vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, because they often get much better mileage than purely gasoline-powered vehicles. Browse the web and study the features of four or five of today’s popular hybrid cars, then list as many of their hybrid-related attributes as you can. Some common attributes include city-miles-per-gallon and highway-miles-per-gallon. Also list the attributes of the batteries (type, weight, etc.). 
//a. Fuel Efficiency
//b. Battery Type
//c. Battery Weight & Capacity
//d. Regenerative Braking
//e. Dual Power System

//1.12 (Gender Neutrality) 
//Many people want to eliminate sexism in all forms of communication. You’ve been asked to create a program that can process a paragraph of text and replace gender-specific words with gender-neutral ones. Assuming that you’ve been given a list of gender-specific words and their gender-neutral replacements (e.g., replace both “wife” and “husband” with “spouse,” “man” and “woman” with “person,” “daughter” and “son” with “child”), explain the procedure you’d use to read through a paragraph of text and manually perform these replacements. How might your procedure generate a strange term like “woperchild?” You’ll soon learn that a more formal term for “procedure” is “algorithm,” and that an algorithm specifies the steps to be performed and the order in which to perform them. We’ll show how to develop algorithms then convert them to Java programs which can be run on computers.
//a. Read the paragraph text.
//b. Identify gendered words (example: "husband" → "spouse").
//c. Replace words using a predefined dictionary.
//d. Ensure no unintended combinations like “woperchild” occur by handling substring replacements carefully.
//e. Output the revised paragraph.
